# plant-human-interface
 In cooperation with the LoRaWan group of Verschwörhaus Ulm, the artist and computer scientist bleeptrack developed an interactive digital installation that deals with the future of our plant-based food production. The focus is on the inner state of real plants that grow in one of Verschwörhaus' plant beds. These are equipped with several LoRa Sensors, whoses measurement data provide the basis for the generative visualization. The work was built for the project KULTURSAATEN by Brot & Kunst Museum Ulm.
